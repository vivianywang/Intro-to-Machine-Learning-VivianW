# Intro to Machine Learning Starter Code

This is the Starter Code for the Cardiotree Classifier project. Use this code to remix this project and start from Part #1 of the Cardiotree Classifier.


### Project Requirements
Your project should:
- Show the dataframe after being label encoded and one hot encoded.
- Use at least two parameters when creating your Decision Tree.
- Print the training accuracy score, testing accuracy score, and confusion matrix.
- Print how a Decision Tree can be applied to a different field, and give 2-3 factors to be wary of.
- Print a text representation of your Decision Tree through the console.


### Extensions
You can extend your project further by:
- Examine feature importance
- Create a random forest

## File Overview

### ← README.md

README.md file give you more documentation and information about a program. They are super helpful for describing what a program should do, any issues you've encountered, changes you want to make, and more. 

### ← main.py
This is where you will write your main program.

### ← heartDisease_2020_sampling.csv
This csv file contains data on factors of heart disease. You can learn more about this dataset in your worksheet in Part 2: https://assets.ctfassets.net/idmfh0ehr6d7/3gBpyycY5ShWzLSG3GuH2K/cb483e835f1d29eeaa74d29d1453a9b8/Intro_to_Machine_Learning_Worksheets.pdf

### ← GWCutilities.py
This file contains helper functions you can call in main.py.
