# Girls Who Code Intro to Machine Learning

This program is used to detect if a patient has heart disease. First, it prints out a sample of the data that we will be using then it will encode all necessary attributes. It will then print the accuracies of the training and test data sets as well as the confusion matrix. Finally, it will print out more information on possibilities for decision tress and will also print out the decision tree (in text form) that the program generates to decide if a patient has heart disease.
